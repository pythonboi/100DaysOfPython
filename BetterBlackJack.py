## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

# Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:

import random


# Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
# 11 is the Ace.

def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

    new_card = random.choice(cards)

    return new_card


deal_card()

# Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().

user_cards = []
computer_cards = []
game_on = False

user_cards.append(deal_card())
if len(user_cards) < 2:
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    #print(user_cards)

computer_cards.append(deal_card())
if len(computer_cards) < 2:
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
    # print(f"computer first card: {computer_cards[0]}")


# Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
# and returns the score.
# Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

def calculate_score(user_score, computer_score):
    user_score = user_cards
    computer_score = computer_cards

    if user_cards[0] == 11 and user_cards[1] == 10:
        return 0
    if user_cards[0] == 10 and user_cards[1] == 11:
        return 0

    if computer_cards[0] == 11 and computer_cards[1] == 10:
        return 0
    if computer_cards[0] == 10 and computer_cards[1] == 11:
        return 0

    if sum(user_cards) > 21:
        if user_cards[0] == 11 or user_cards[1] == 11:
            user_cards.remove(11)
            user_cards.append(1)

    if sum(computer_cards) > 21:
        if computer_cards[0] == 11 or computer_cards[1] == 11:
            computer_cards.remove(11)
            computer_cards.append(1)

    # if user_cards == 0 or computer_cards == 0:
    # return user_cards, computer_cards

    return sum(user_score), sum(computer_score)


print(f"Your cards {user_cards}, Total card: {sum(user_cards)}")
print(f"computer first card: {computer_cards[0]}")

calculate_score(user_cards, computer_cards)
user, computer = calculate_score(user_cards, computer_cards)

# print(type(user))
print(user)
print(computer)
# print(type(computer))

# Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

# Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

# Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

if user == 0 or computer == 0 or user > 21:
    game_on = True

# Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List.
# If no, then the game has ended.

if not game_on:
    question = (input("Do you want to draw another card:? ")).lower()
    if question == 'y':
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        calculate_score(user, computer)
    else:
        game_on = True

# Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

# Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

# Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

# Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
