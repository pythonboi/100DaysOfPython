# ############## Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

# # The deck is unlimited in size.
# # There are no jokers.
# # The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# # The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# # Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# # cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# # The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# # Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# # The computer is the dealer.

# #################### Hints #####################

# Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
# Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

# Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
# Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

# Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

# Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
# 11 is the Ace.

# Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card.
# If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

# Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and
# the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.


# Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play.
# The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.


# Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score.
# If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0),
# then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21,
# then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses.
# If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

# play = input("Do you want restart the game:? 'y' for 'yes and 'n' for no").lower()
#
# if play == 'y':
#     calculate_score(user_cards, computer_cards)
#
# else:
#     exit()

# Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game.
# If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
